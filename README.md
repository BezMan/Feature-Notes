# Feature-Notes
Wouldn't it be great to detect and copy text from within our photos?  
How about adding note items while OTHER apps are in the foreground?

These are some useful features you'll find in this app and I can't wait to add more!

 This project is written in Kotlin and showcases these concepts:

- Architecture Components: MVVM, Room, Kotlin Flow in conjunction with Live Data.
- Dependency Injection with Dagger Hilt (Repository, NotificationManager and ViewModel).
- Transitioning between Fragments with Navigation Drawer layout.
- Parcelable Note data class, so we can pass it between Activities.
- TypeConverter for storing non-primitive object types in Room Database.
- ItemTouchHelper callbacks for gesture detection: drag & drop items.
- Custom Views (Dialog popups) managing their own UI setup and lifecycle.
- Note priority influences the order of notes displayed within list.
- Generating primary key, where insert() provides us a unique note id.
- Auto-scroll to bottom of list when adding note items to the end.
- Displaying notes as Notifications, for quick add, even while watching a video.
- Restore deleted/archived notes and items, through quick SnackBar undo action.
- Reverting changes is possible during the note editing session.
- Share notes easily + quick text copy of individual note items.
- Settings Activity - simple example using Jetpack Preferences
- Click to ~~Strike Through note items~~ and mark them as DONE.
- Espresso Instrumentation tests across multiple activities.
- Text Recognition - extracting words and numbers from your photos.
