# Feature-Notes
Wouldn't it be great to detect and copy text from within our photos?  
How about adding note items while OTHER apps are in the foreground?

These are some useful features you'll find in this app and I can't wait to add more!

 This project contains and showcases these concepts:

- Kotlin language + Kotlin extension functions.
- Architecture Components: MVVM, Room, Live Data, Observing DB changes.
- Dependency Injection with Koin: injecting Repository, NotificationManager and ViewModel.
- Using Kotlin Coroutines for necessary asynchronous DB operations.
- Parcelable Note data class, so we can pass it between Activities.
- TypeConverter for storing non-primitive object types in Room Database.
- Database ViewModel - a single data entry point for all activities.
- ItemTouchHelper callbacks for gesture detection: drag & drop items.
- Custom Views (AlertDialog) managing their own UI setup and lifecycle.
- Setting a priority for each note, influences the order in the main list.
- Toolbar layouts containing menu items in conjunction with custom menu layouts.
- Data persistence, so we don‚Äôt lose data, even when app task is removed.
- auto generated primary key, where insert() provides us a unique ID val.
- Nested ScrollView with auto scroll when adding bottom note items.
- Text Recognition - extract words and numbers from your photos (Firebase Machine Learning API).
- Setting notes as Notifications, for quick add, even while watching a video.
- RESTORE deleted notes and items, through SnackBar action.
- REVERT CHANGES menu item, during note editing session.
- Share notes easily + quick text copy of individual note items.
- click to ~~Strike Through note items~~ and mark them as DONE.
- Espresso Instrumentation tests across multiple activities.

I know there are some basic features I haven‚Äôt included, I can't do everything on my own...  
Feel free to join the coding ‚≠ê and I'm open to hearing your thoughts and suggestions ü§ôüèΩ
